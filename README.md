This data shows an interactive bar, gauge, and bubble chart to show the volunteers of the study the top 10 types of bacterial species that are growing inside their navels.

Researchers then analyzed the samples and found more than 2,300 kinds of bacteria. That's an average of 67 different kinds per belly button.

Thanks to this study, researchers will be able to identify if the right species of bacteria can potentially be a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef.

Volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.
